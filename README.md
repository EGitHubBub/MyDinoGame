My Dino Game is based on the original Google Chrome Dino Game (T-rex Runner) that appeared in a browser when the internet connection was lost.

It was created as an ai experiment and learning experience. I started with a query to Gemini (LLM) for html code to make a game based on the original. The initial draft was a promising starting point. From there, I added the code to VisualStudio Code and worked with CoPilot AI to refine and complete the game.
